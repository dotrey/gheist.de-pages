# Kanjiland
I started learning Japanese twice in the past, once back at the university, and a second time after I had the feeling it would be a shame not to continue with it, but couldn’t find a course that would continue where I stopped, minus the things I had already forgotten. I even took and passed the JLPT N5, the lowest level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.

One of the most exhausting tasks when learning Japanese are the kanji (at least, in my opinion). There are many of them, they look completely foreign (ok, fair enough, the other japanese alphabets share this feature) and one small additional or forgotten stroke changes the whole meaning.

Ever since the first few kanji I had to learn, I was thinking how this learning-process could be gamified, and kanjiland is my latest idea (the name was chosen as a simple working title and might change in the future, although I’ve grown quite fond of it).

> Small excursion: The japanese language uses two syllable-alphabets (hiragana and katakana), with 46 different "basic" symbols each. These symbols have a few additional variants and some can also be combined, but this is still the easy part. 
> Besides hiragana and katakana, Japanese also uses kanji. A kanji is a symbol that was imported from chinese characters long ago and since then developed in Japan (in fact, hiragana and katakana were also derived from the chinese characters). Due to this, many kanji gained a second *japanese* meaning, in addition to the original *chinese* meaning, and thus the same symbol might be pronounced differently depending on the context.
> The absolute number of kanji is hard to determine, but there are about 13000 defined within industry standards.
> Luckily, the number of commonly used kanji is in the 2000-3000 region though.

There are some aspects to "learning a kanji", roughly in this order:
- meaning (there might be multiple)
- pronunciation (aka reading, again there might be multiple)
- stroke order (which must not be underestimated when trying to read a bad handwriting)
Cramming all of these aspects into one game might be a huge task and probably difficult to keep the game fun at the same time. For kanjiland the plan is to focus on the meaning first, but still making the reading visible throughout the game, hoping that the player subconsciously picks it up while playing.

The initial idea for kanjiland was born when I watched my wife playing Stardew Valley and thought, what if instead all those items laying on the floor, there were just kanji laying around? What if instead of cows walking around your in-game barn there would be 牛 (cow-kanji) walking around. Of course there would have to be some way to learn the meaning behind all the kanji you see, and once you learned it, the cow-kanji would be replaced by the image of an actual cow.

The NPCs would then send you on a quest to e.g. get them an apple or some fresh milk. But since the NPCs will always use kanji to describe their requests, the player would have to learn the meaning of them, to find a tree with apples or a cow for some milk.
