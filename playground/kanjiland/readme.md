# Kanjiland
Kanjiland is my idea and attempt to help me with learning Japanese, and especially kanji, "simply" by playing a game. It is, of course, also a great opportunity for me to work on a larger project with TypeScript.

With this little dev log, I will try to keep track of kanjiland's progress.
