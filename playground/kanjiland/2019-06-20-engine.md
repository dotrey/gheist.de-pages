# Kanjiland - The Engine

So, I decided to work on a new game again, and one of the first things to decide from a technical point of view, is the engine to use.
This decision mainly depends on the desired style for the game and what you are already familiar with.

## The Style
Since the idea arose when I saw Stardew Valley, a 2D top-down game, this was the initial start for the game's style. I was thinking about
going 3D briefly, but for the purpose of teaching kanji by replacing in-game objects with their respective kanjis, I found the 2D top-down
style way better. And since I also have next to no experience in creating 3D assets, I didn't want to add this additional learning curve on top.

For the art, I decided to go with a pixelated look. Mainly because this is something I can create by myself in a decent quality, but also
does this allow me to emphasize the kanji by making them the only thing in the game that is not pixelated. Instead, the kanji will be
smooth and anti-aliased. This is also done to focus on the learning aspect, as it keeps the look of the kanji clean and makes it easier to
recognize the strokes.

## Components of an Engine - Graphics
With the art style decided and 3D off the table, it was time to decide how to realize those 2D images that currently only existed in my head.
I had created a small game engine before, using the HTML Canvas to draw 2D scenes. However, this engine was far from finished and had many
open points regarding what else could be done when rendering the textures onto the canvas.

But luckily, I stumbled on [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/), which looked like everything I needed. It provides the 2D drawing capability
I want, using either the HTML Canvas or when possible WebGL for better performance. PixiJS also brings a few more useful tools to the table,
but the best thing is: you don't have to use all of them.

## Components of an Engine - The Loop
Beside the ability to render graphics, the probably most important part of the engine is the loop or game loop. The game loop is the heart
of the engine. While the loop is running, it triggers the updates to all objects in the game and also tells the renderer to draw something.
When the loop stops, the engine stops. PixiJS brings its own loop, but I decided to use the loop I built for my older engine and only use
PixiJS to do the actual rendering.

The loop will do two things (mainly):
- Tell PixiJS to draw as often as possible. While PixiJS is drawing, the loop can't continue, so the number of how often something is drawn depends on the power of the system the engine is running on and on how much there is to draw. This number per second are the FPS, frames (drawn) per second.
- Update the objects inside the game, e.g. if there is an object moving across the screen, update its position and move it a few pixels to the right. Same as with the drawing, this takes some time depending on the number of objects and compute power. My engine reports this as UPS, updates per second.
Now, there is one more thing to consider with the updates. If you treat them just like the render calls, the number of updates might be higher or lower on different devices, meaning the e.g. position of an object is updated more times or fewer. If you then change the position of an object by fixed amount of movement per update call, the object would move faster on the device with the better performance, and slower on the one with less compute power.

One way to fix this problem is to give the object a certain velocity, and when updating its position, to also take into account the time that has elapsed since the last update of the object's position. Another situation where variable UPS poses a problem would be a simple sprite animation. Let's assume the animation consists of 4 individual images (animation step) and has a total duration of 1 second. To make sure the animation plays with the same speed, no matter how many update calls there are, we can use some kind of velocity for how fast we change the displayed image of the animation step. And there are probably many more situations like that.
