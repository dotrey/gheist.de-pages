# Kanjiland - The Engine

So, I decided to work on a new game again, and one of the first things to decide from a technical point of view, is the engine to use.
This decision mainly depends on the desired style for the game and what you are already familiar with.

## The Style
Since the idea arose when I saw Stardew Valley, a 2D top-down game, this was the initial start for the game's style. I was thinking about
going 3D briefly, but for the purpose of teaching kanji by replacing in-game objects with their respective kanjis, I found the 2D top-down
style way better. And since I also have next to no experience in creating 3D assets, I didn't want to add this additional learning curve on top.
