# Have you seen this gheist?
This is a test and documentation on how well Google understands the hashbang `!#` links used on this site, and how good the page can be found using Google Search.

## 2020-02-22
Searching for `site:gheist.de` returns 2 results:
- the first page of `gheist.de`, with all the rotating keywords
- qr ghost, which is available by a regular url  on `/qr`

No other pages are listed, this means that none of the hashbang links were followed!
Note that there is no link referencing the qr ghost url, even the privacy url in the playstore is a hashbang ur pointing to `https://gheist.de/#!qr/privacy.md`.

To better understand how Google indexes this website, I have enabled the Google Search Console for `gheist.de`. Unfortunately, it tells me to check back tomorrow as the data is still being processed.
