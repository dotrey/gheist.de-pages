# about
I'm currently working at storytile, a startup based in Munich and aiming to provide the best live blogging solution. Here I am coordinating the development, coding and managing a large part of our server infrastructure.

Before an old friend called me over to Munich, I was travelling the south-west of Germany as an IT consultant for a medium-sized company, working with the IT departments of some large insurance and mobility related companies.

## how it all started
Back in the 90s, I was already dabbling around with my father's PC. And then in 1998, for my 11th birthday, I received a ~~letter from Hogwarts~~ boxed copy of Visual Basic 6. At the beginning I was mainly messing around with the GUI designer without much functionality. This changed when I wanted to know more about the why and how behind the code, and finally got my first programming book.

Thereafter I kept creating small games and tools, sticking to VB6 at first but soon also looking into web development (oh yes, with that ugly old JavaScript) and later Java and the .NET family (VB.NET at first, later mainly C#). Over the years I created various little projects (the oldest unfortunately lost due to a hard drive failure), from little Invader like games over memory-reading bots for other games to simple local network messengers. With the growth of the internet I of course needed a website for my projects, which started with DOGX Games and finally led to gheist.de in its current 6th version. 

Besides programming, I enjoy playing some good old board games or Dungeons and Dragons, which I was always curious about and luckily found a group to play with in Munich. Other than that, I always loved travelling and especially fell in love with Japan. My efforts to learn Japanese are a bit on and off, but a few basics still stick with me.
