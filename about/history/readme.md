# gheist.de - v6
The website you are looking at is the currently 6th version of gheist.de. The initial version went live on 16.05.2010 and evolved over the years to its current state.

Unlike all previous versions, the current website is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). This means there is no database in the background storing the data. Instead, everything is written as markdown files and converted to HTML with my little project [here](/playground/md2html/).

This adds the minor benefit that the content can also be viewed somewhat good-looking in the repository, as GitHub also renders the markdown files.

Feel free to have a look at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotrey/gheist.de-pages), but keep in mind that while the raw Markdown files are readable, they are tailored for the website version.

Building a complete new version of the website also means facing some new challenges. I will try to wrap them up in a few short reads below.

# Previous Versions

## gheist.de - v5
This was the initial evolution of v4, but was never finished. During development of v5, the new .dev-domain went live, where I tried to get a nice new domain. But I failed to get the domain I wanted, and the prototype I had worked on for the new domain became version 6 of gheist.de.

## gheist.de - v4
![gheist.de - v4](/about/history/gheistde-v4.jpg){image-top cover}
This version went live on 16.05.2016 and served well for three years, until it was superseded by version 6. The updates focused on the overall page structure, with a few small design changes sprinkled in.

## gheist.de - v3
This version went live on 04.10.2014 and consisted mainly of a refreshed design.

## gheist.de - v2
This version went live on 26.04.2012, bringing a large update to the backend of the page by moving to a new CMS.

## gheist.de - v1
This is it, the first version of gheist.de I ever launched on 16.05.2010! But of course not the first website. In fact, gheist.de was the successor of dogx-games.de (talking about some youthful follies...).

## dogx-games.de
Yes, this is it. My very first domain. I had various small websites on different free hosters before, but in 2005 the time for my very own top-level domain had finally come. And obviously, my main interests back then were dogs and developing games.
