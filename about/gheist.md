# History
The website you are looking at is the currently 6th version of gheist.de.
The initial version went live on 16.05.2010 and evolved over the years to
its current state.

# gheist.de - v6
This is the current version. Unlike all previous versions, this site is hosted
on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). This means there is no database
in the background storing the data. Instead, everything is written as markdown
files and converted to HTML with my little project [here](/playground/md2html/).
This adds the little benefit that the content could also be viewed somewhat 
good-looking in the repository, as github also renders the markdown files.

# gheist.de - v5
This was the initial evolution of v4, but was never finished. During development
of v5, the new .dev-domain went live, where I tried to get a nice new domain. But
I failed to get the domain I wanted, and the prototype I had worked on for the 
new domain became version 6 of gheist.de.

This version went live on 16.05.2016 and served well for three years, until it was
superseded by version 6. The updates focused on the overall page structure, whith
a few small design changes sprinkled in.

# gheist.de - v3
This version went live on 04.10.2016 and consited mainly of a refreshed design.

# gheist.de - v2
This version went live on 26.04.2012, bringing a large update to the backend of the
page by moving to a new CMS.

# gheist.de - v1
This is it, the first version of gheist.de I ever launched! But of course not the
first website. In fact, gheist.de was the successor of dogx-games.de (talking about
some youthful follies...).

# dogx-games.de
Yes, this is it. My very first domain. I had various small websites on different
free hosters before, but in 2005 the time for my very own top-level domain had 
finally come. And obviously, my main interests back then were dogs and developing games.
